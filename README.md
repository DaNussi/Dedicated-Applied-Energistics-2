## About

This Minecraft mod aims to make [Applied Energistics 2](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2) work across multiple servers.

### Why is there a need for this mod?
 In large modpacks, servers can get extremely laggy because of large scale automation. A solution to this problem would be to connect multiple ME systems, on different servers together in order to spread the load.

### How dose the mod archive this?
Currently only the inventory is synchronised between servers. Meaning that cross server auto crafting doesn't work yet. The plan is to make the entire ME system work in the "cloud" with all features.

## Items

### Inter Dimensional Storage Cell
The Inter Dimensional Storage Cell connects to a redis database and stores all items in it. It is optimised to work with as many item types as possible.

#### Limitations
* +10.000 item types supportet
* 2^64 max item amount per item type

## Blocks

### Inter Dimensional Interface
This block is planned to hold the [Inter Dimensional Storage Cell](#inter-dimensional-storage-cell), but it is currently bugged.
